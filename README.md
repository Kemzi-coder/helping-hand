# Helping Hand
Q&A website for students.
## Warning:
The project code is not up to date and does not reflect my current skills.

## The story:
It was supposed to be a Q&A site for students, but the project never saw a release. The team broke up because of doubts about the idea and the project was never finalized.
\
I partially recreated the API in order to demonstrate some functionality of the application. Most of the functionality doesn't work, but the main functionality at least works to demonstrate the interface.
\
The fate of this project has taught me that you should think about an idea very well before you start a large-scale project and fully immerse yourself in it. Otherwise, your energy and time will be spent in the wrong direction.

## Tech stack used:
- TypeScript
- React, Redux Toolkit, Formik

## Getting started:
Run the development server and mock API:
```bash
npm start
```
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
